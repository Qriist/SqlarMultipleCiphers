# SqlarMultipleCiphers
Auto-built DLLs of SQLite3MultipleCiphers, with the SQLite Archive functions enabled.

Full automation/releasing is in the works, but for now you can grab the dlls in the `built` folder.

All DLLs come with the Sqlar functions, but also some combination of being ICU-enabled and/or/nor UPX-packed.
