# SqlarMultipleCiphers
Auto-built DLLs of [@utelle](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers)'s [SQLite3MultipleCiphers](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers), with the [SQLite Archive](https://www.sqlite.org/sqlar.html) functions enabled.

All versions come with the Sqlar functions by default, and also some combination of being ICU-enabled and/or/nor UPX-packed.

Full automation/releasing is in the works. For now, you can grab whichever flavor of dlls you need from the `built` folder.
