# SqlarMultipleCiphers
Auto-built DLLs of [@utelle](https://github.com/utelle)'s [SQLite3MultipleCiphers](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers), with the [SQLite Archive](https://www.sqlite.org/sqlar.html) functions enabled.

Every provided version comes with the Sqlar functions by default, and also some combination of being ICU-enabled and/or/nor UPX-packed.

Full automation/releasing is in the works. For now, you can grab whichever flavor of dlls you need from the [built](https://github.com/Qriist/SqlarMultipleCiphers/tree/master/built) folder.

 <sup><sub>All the useful code in these DLLs is credited to utelle and SQLite. I just flipped a switch.</sub></sup>
