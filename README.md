# SqlarMultipleCiphers
Auto-built DLLs of @utelle's SQLite3MultipleCiphers, with the SQLite Archive functions enabled.

All versions come with the Sqlar functions by default, and also some combination of being ICU-enabled and/or/nor UPX-packed.

Full automation/releasing is in the works, but for now you can grab whichever flavor of dlls you need from the `built` folder.
